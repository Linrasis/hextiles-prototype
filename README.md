You will need to pre-install the [three.js](http://threejs.org) library (r60 or better) and symlink it into the ```public``` folder so that the demo can find the files that it needs (see [index.html](public/index.html)).

* this is a single-player demo
* developer preview: _it's a place for me to play with new ideas_

### Getting started..

* ```npm install hextiles-prototype```
* ```cd hextiles-prototype```
* type ```npm install``` to download dependency modules, _you only need to do this once_ (requires [node.js](http://nodejs.org))
* type ```npm start``` to start the server running
* visit ```http://localhost:8000``` in your browser to start the demo

Use WASD or cursor keys to move around

_Collisions are not implemented so you can just run through things_
